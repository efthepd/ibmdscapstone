Data used:

1. Foursquare location data. API used to retrieve retail locations and types from the area around existing gardens, arboretums and similar venues
within the Northeast United states â€” consisting of New England, in addition to New York and Pennsylvania. 

2. A state-by-state directory of botanical Gardens and Arboretum is located here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_botanical_gardens_and_arboretums_in_the_United_States
and data is scraped from individual pages. Exact location is gathered using the Nominatim if possible, but if this can't be found coordinates for the city in which the
venue is used instead.
