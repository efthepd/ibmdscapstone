A non-profit is interested in establishing a public garden and institution of conservantion in Burlington, Vermont, 
however they have not exactly settled on a profit model as some of their revenue will come from grants and public funding, 
but they would like to supplement that income through other arrangements - for example charging admissions, hosting events, 
pledge drives, weddings or any number of other possible sources of revenue. There are, however, a great many possible ways 
they might achieve this. This foundation would like to find out what existing venues might be most similar to theirs, 
so that they can investigate the profit models these businesses have pursued. Project will identify such a cluster, 
and provide a list of names for the client to investigate further on their own.
